            <h3>How/when will this be built?</h3>

            <p>This sculpture will be constructed in its full 8ft tall glory in the afternoon of August 29, 2025, on the <a class="cmu-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//40.44247,-79.945807/@40.4425075,-79.9456699,20.94z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="blank">Wean Hall patio</a> (near the front of La Prima). If you'd like to participate, feel free to fill out the <a class="cmu-link" href="https://forms.gle/JWc4mdYsHJXYJq5c8" target="blank">interest form</a>, or just show up on the day of: we'll need all the hands we can get. There will be free food probably. </p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>This sculpture is a mathematical <strong class="definition" id="graph-term">graph</strong> (or rather, a <strong class="definition" id="embedding-term">visual representation</strong> of one), with "edges" made from aluminum strips connecting the "vertices" (joints) together. You'll notice that even though the vertices are flexible, the structure stands without collapsing (so far): this graph is what's called <strong class="definition" id="rigid-term">rigid</strong>. Rigid structures are an important part of bridges, skyscrapers, and the like, where engineers often incorporate <strong class="definition" id="three-cycle-term" >triangles</strong> for structural stability due to their naturally rigid nature. Remarkably, however, this graph contains no triangles at all (trace a few edges and see for yourself!), but still holds itself up. </p>

            <p>The graph's edges correspond to the possible moves of a knight piece from chess (2 spaces/vertices in one direction, and 1 in another), but on a 3-dimensional chessboard measuring 4 squares on each side. There are 288 such moves, which is enough to connect every space to every other. Interestingly, we can show mathematically that any large enough chessboard's squares are all accessible from any other square by enough moves of the knight (the graph is <strong class="definition" id="connected-term">connected</strong>)</p>

            <p>Finding rigid graphs with edges of a single <strong class="definition" id="unitlength-term">unit length</strong> is an interesting mathematical challenge. It turns out versions of this graph (and more complex generalizations) exist for spaces of arbitrary dimension.

    <div class="definitions-container">
        <div id="graph-term-def">Mathematically, an (undirected) graph is a set $V$ of objects called "vertices", along with a set $E$ of unordered pairs $\{v, w\}$ for $v, w \in V$ representing "edges" or connections between vertices $v$ and $w$. Often, additional conditions are put in place (for example, no edges such that $v=w$). </div>
        <div id="embedding-term-def">To make it more interesting, we've "embedded" this graph in 3D space ($\mathbb{R}^3$) so you can look at it. Embedding a graph $(V, E)$ in a space $S$ consists of finding an injective function $f: V \to S$ (representing which points the vertices are located at), and another injective function $g: E \to 2^S$ representing the paths our edges such that $g(\{v, w\})$ is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]$ (i.e. it's a line), and that $g(\{v, w\})$ starts at $v$, ends at $w$, and doesn't cross through any other vertices. There's usually some other requirements for $g$: for example, because we have to build it physically out of straight aluminum bars, the edges must also be relatively straight. </div>
        <div id="rigid-term-def">A graph $(V, E)$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be "infinitesimally rigid" if any possible movement of the graph's vertices involves only translating them by the same amount, i.e. their position relative to each other is unchanged. Mathematically, this holds if for any vector field $f: V \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\forall (x, y) \in V$, $(f(x)-f(y)) \cdot (x-y) = 0$ (i.e. a tiny motion of the vertices), $f$ is equal to the restriction to $V$ of some other vector field $g : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that also $\forall (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^n,$ $(g(x)-g(y)) \cdot (x-y) = 0$ (a tiny motion of the entire space). </div>
        <div id="three-cycle-term-def">In graph theory, we'd call these "3-cycles"; paths from a vertex back to itself that visit exactly three separate vertices. </div>
        <div id="connected-term-def">A "path" between two vertices $v$ and $w$ is a sequence of vertices beginning at $v$ and ending at $w$ such that each pair of adjacent verticees in the sequence have an edge between them. A graph is "connected" if there is a path between any two vertices. </div>
        <div id="unitlength-term-def">The length of any edge is of course relative to the embedding used (see above). A graph embedded in a metric space is called a "unit-distance graph" (sometimes called a "unit-bar framework") if the distance between any two vertices that share an edge is always the same. </div>
